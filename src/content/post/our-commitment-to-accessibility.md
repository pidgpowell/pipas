At Atomic Software, we believe in the transformative power of education, and are committed to ensuring that this power is accessible to all students and teachers.

Our commitment to accessibility is rooted in the core values that drive our company. We recognize that a diverse range of users interact with your products, and we are dedicated to creating inclusive experiences that cater to the unique needs of each individual.

Our commitment extends beyond mere compliance with accessibility standards; it is a holistic approach embedded in our company culture. We believe in prioritizing accessibility from the outset by establishing comprehensive policies and processes that guide our teams in integrating accessibility into every stage of the software development life cycle. Our process begins as the team researches and learns about its users; then, through an iterative design delivery workflow, we establish a collaborative design/development process that saves time and money by allowing for questions and obstacles to be resolved early and often in the process. Finally, before any feature is released, it undergoes a thorough quality assurance process that combines automated and manual testing to ensure the feature meets the project's accessibility standards.

By making products accessible, we contribute to a more inclusive digital landscape. We firmly believe that technology should empower every student and teacher, and our commitment to accessibility reflects our dedication to making this vision a reality.
